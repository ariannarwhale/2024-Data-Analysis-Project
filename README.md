# Data-Visualization-Project
Fall 2024 Capstone Group Project

<b>E-Commerce Data Analysis: A Data Analysis (EDA) Project</b>
<br>Introduction: This project investigates and analyzes the e-commerce store data to gain a deeper understanding of the trends in this store's users, products, and orders. We leverage the power of Python and essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze statistics, manipulate, and visualize data to address real-world questions about this fictional business.

<br>

<b>Project Goals:</b>
<ul><li>Data Import: Set up a BigQuery sandbox.</li>
<li>Data Cleaning: Filter the dataset, handle any missing or inconsistent data, and perform data transformations.</li>
<li>Data Analysis: Utilize Numpy to calculate statistical computations and metrics.</li>
<li>Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib to highlight key insights.</li>
<li>Insights: Based on EDA findings, identify key insights based on the analysis.</li>
<li>Reporting: Summarize EDA results in a well-documented Colab Python Notebook and present findings using clear and compelling visualizations to enhance understanding.</li></ul>

<br>

<b>Project Deliverables:</b>
<ul><li>A comprehensive Colab Python Notebook showcasing data analysis process.</li>
<li>Informative and visually appealing Matplotlib plots illustrating EDA findings.</li>
<li>A brief presentation summarizing key insights and recommendations.</li></ul>
